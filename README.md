# COVID-19 Face Mask Detector

![Mask Detection](face-mask-detector.jpeg)


## Overview

The COVID-19 Face Mask Detector is a project aimed at promoting public health and safety by detecting whether individuals are wearing face masks or not. The system utilizes a combination of deep learning techniques and computer vision to identify faces and determine if masks are being worn correctly.

## Features

- Detection of faces using the Haar Cascade XML for accurate face recognition.
- Utilizes Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with VGG16 architecture for mask detection.
- Implementation in Jupyter Notebook for easy experimentation and testing.
- Real-time mask detection using a webcam interface.
- Hosted on GitHub for open access, collaboration, and further development.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Gyanaranjan-934/Covid-19-Face-Mask-Detector`
